   ## Components TODO
      [ ] Build out StocksContainer
         - is a class component
         - must have state for stocks data { stocks: [...] }
         - uses componentDidMount on render 
         - componentDidMount fetches stocks from backend and
           sets state
         - calls Stocks component inside render 
         - passes state as props to Stocks
